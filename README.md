# Learnings on analyzing the Seattle airbnb datasets

Understand lodging services in Seattle using Airbnb data

*Using CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining), investigate Seattle Airbnb data and answer the following questions.*

1.	Which is the most popular neighborhood in Seattle? And similarly which is the least popular area in Seattle? What can we tell by looking at their monthly pricing trends?
2.	How does price fluctuate over time? Is there any seasonal effect over pricing?
3.	What are the main amenities? There will be many in the catalog but we will try to find the main profiles
4.	What are the different features that decide the pricing?
5.	Can we classify the properties? It would be nice to see what features bring the properties together and what separates them


### Software Requirements
* Python 3.x
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit-Learn

### Project Instructions

1. Install required packages.
2. Clone the repository (including data)
3. Run Seattle_Airbnb notebook file.

### Results
Through this project we went through Seattle Airbnb dataset and created some visualizations to understand what are the major popular areas in Seattle are. We also understood the following:
1.	Most popular may not be holding many properties for rent
2.	Average prices per properties are trending upward
3.	Better rated neighborhood have average prices higher than that of Seattle, probably better amenities are being provided
